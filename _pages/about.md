I am a comparativist studying Political Economy in the Department of Government at Harvard. My substantive interests lie in institutions, constitutional-legal design, and judicial politics, with a regional focus on Latin America. Broadly, I want to understand the conditions under which institutions can promote socioeconomic development.

Before joining Harvard, I completed a dual MA in International Public Affairs and Latin American Studies at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, where I worked as a lecturer in the Department of Political Science. Outside academia, I served as a judge for five years in São Paulo, Brazil.

During my time in court, I witnessed first-hand how efforts to yield welfare gains through legal instruments, without considering the sociopolitical landscape, tend to fall short. If societies are to solve structural problems and improve their populations’ lives, further research is needed on the interconnections between Politics, Law, and Economics. My research agenda addresses this intersection, investigating how legal and political factors interact to impact citizens’ well-being.

I am currently working on two projects. The first intends to measure the distributional effects of the judicialization of social policies in Brazil. In countries where millions lack basic conditions for a dignified life, common wisdom suggests that legal institutions can produce social progress via judicial proactivity. However, given that multiple barriers still prevent the poorest citizens from litigating, uneven access to justice might accrue benefits to upper classes, more endowed with resources to litigate. It is likewise unclear whether judicialization diverts blame attribution to the atomized enforcement of rights, alleviating political pressure, or if activist courts alienate structural changes that demand political capital and grassroots support. The second project assess the aspirational content of South American constitutions via text mining. Preliminary evidence, drawn from latent growth modeling, suggests that the ontological gap between formal rights and socioeconomic reality has enlarged over time. This finding stresses that “good” laws have limited effect if the sociopolitical context is discounted.
