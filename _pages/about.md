I am a comparativist interested in constitutional-legal design, institutional weakness, and judicial politics, with a focus on Latin America. Broadly, I want to understand the conditions under which legal institutions can promote socioeconomic development.

I have been teaching Law (constitutional, jurisprudence, and crime policy) for more than a decade in Brazil. In 2020, I joined the Department of Political Science at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, serving first as a teaching and research assistant and more recently as a lecturer. Outside academia, I served as a judicial clerk for three years and as a judge for five years in São Paulo, Brazil.

During my time in court, I witnessed first-hand how efforts to yield welfare gains through legal instruments, without considering the sociopolitical landscape, tend to fall short. If societies are to solve structural problems and improve their populations’ lives, further research is needed on the interconnections between Politics, Law, and Economics. My research agenda addresses this intersection, investigating how legal and political factors interact to impact citizens’ well-being.

I am currently working on a project assessing the aspirational content of South American constitutions via text mining. Preliminary evidence, drawn from latent growth modeling, suggests that the ontological gap between formal rights and socioeconomic reality has enlarged over time. This finding stresses that “good” laws have limited effect if the sociopolitical context is discounted.
